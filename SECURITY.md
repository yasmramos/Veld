## Disclosure Policy

Veld Framework follows a responsible disclosure process:

1. **Private Report**: Security researcher reports vulnerability privately to our security team
2. **Assessment**: We validate the report, assess severity, and assign a CVSS score
3. **Development**: We develop and test the fix without public awareness
4. **Notification**: We notify users of the upcoming security release (minimum 7 days before release)
5. **Release**: We publish the security advisory and patched version on GitHub
6. **Public Disclosure**: Full details are published after users have had reasonable time to upgrade

## Severity Classification

We classify vulnerabilities using the CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) 3.1 framework:

| Severity | CVSS Score | Response |
|----------|------------|----------|
| Critical | 9.0 - 10.0 | Patch within 7 days, emergency release |
| High     | 7.0 - 8.9  | Patch within 30 days, next scheduled release |
| Medium   | 4.0 - 6.9  | Patch within 90 days |
| Low      | 0.1 - 3.9  | Patch in next major release |

## Scope

This security policy applies to:

- ✅ Veld Framework core modules (veld-annotations, veld-runtime, veld-processor, veld-weaver)
- ✅ Maven and Gradle plugins
- ✅ Spring Boot integration (veld-spring-boot-starter)
- ✅ All annotations and API surfaces
